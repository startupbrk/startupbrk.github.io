# Results

Winterbrk was organized in Jan-Feb 2014. This was before this blog was started, so I'm publishing these results now. First a few facts:

### 20000 Lines of code

### 69 Students

### 15 Teams

Judged by Ashish Kanodia (IITR, Shri Balaji Industrial Products), Divye Tela (Auriga IT), Nishant Gautam (Auriga IT) and Gaurav Jain (CA, Partner SC Bapna & Associates) in a live presentation followed by a Q&A session at MNIT, this was a very lively start of the Startupbrk series.

Before we get to the results, we would like to thank our sponsors Ashutosh Mundra (Oracle, India), Mukta Sharma (Deloitte, USA) and Gaurav Nolkha (Intel, Swiftday LLC., USA) for their support and encouragement.

Without much further ado, winners of Winterbrk 2014 are:

### 1 Simral Chaudhary and Neha Sharma, Rs. 10000 cash
For their work on Artesania. Judges rewarded thier wholesome effort.

### 2. Arpita Mathur, Astha Gupta, Deenbandhu Agarwal and Pooja Bandal, Rs. 2500 cash
Loved the use of modern web application development techniques used in the creation of Flockers, a simple interest based discovery platform.

### 3. Saatvik Shah and Sanjay Thakur, Rs. 2500 cash
For their beautiful notes taking application, Nano.

Congratulations! And don't forget to boast about it and share with your friends.

Cheers,
Startupbrk team.
