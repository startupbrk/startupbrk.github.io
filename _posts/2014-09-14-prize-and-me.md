### *Solve real problems. Implement practical solutions. Manage a team. Grow a real business.*

## Question posed
Recently a student, sent me the following question:
> I haven't apply for Startupbrk contest 2014, and want to apply in winter. But as I see the result and winners awards. 
There is much difference in 1st, 2nd, 3rd ranker award prize and also there was no internship offers as mentioned. I know it totally depends on the judgement but still it seems unfair.

Quick answer to the question:
* Thank you for taking time to write to us. We really appreciate your feedback. Keep it coming.
* We'll think about the shuffling the prize awards. 
* Internship offers - All the students who have won, are good at what they do and I'm confident they will find good internships. That said we are more than happy to help anyone who wins Startupbrk contest. (Just to be 100% clear though, we dont commit for internships. "maybe even internship" - is what we say on our blog.)

## Food for thought
Leaving aside the quick answer to that question, students looking to participate in Startupbrk should think about the following:
* Take a step back, think about why would you want to participate in Startupbrk? (Hint: Read Startupbrk blog)
* Is the prize money critical and significant enough to make you work on your own idea ? Why cant you work in a grocery store / mall for a month during your winter break, they will surely pay you more than average prize money that you may or may not win by competing in Startupbrk. 
* What do you expect to earn when you start working? Do you think your chances of earning more (even 1K more / month) will increase with participating in Startupbrk? 
* Do you think experience (as they say about grey hair) is valuable?

Feel free to drop an email to me or comment about this in our forum.
