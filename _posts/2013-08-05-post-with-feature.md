I read these two lines somewhere:

"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since." "Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

What I want to convey is simply this: give yourself a nice excuse and opportunity (using startupbrk) to do something awesome - something that you like - something that you wish you had an app for - something that you hate doing manually - something that you think computers are better at. 

You will not only add value to yourself, you will make yourself cooler than those who are 9 or 10 pointers, you will be respected for doing things that are born out of initiative, not necessity or compulsion.

Do it for yourself and for your team, and even win great prizes along the way. 

Happy coding.
